## First Verse 


<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->


The sun was shining on the sea,  
   Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make.   
   The billows smooth and bright—      
And this was odd, because it was.   
   The middle of the night.  

The moon was shining sulkily,    
   Because she thought the sun.   
Had got no business to be there.   
   After the day was done—  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
   "To come and spoil the fun!"

In the garden's gentle breeze,   
A delicate butterfly takes flight.   
Its wings, a canvas of vibrant hues,   
Dancing gracefully in the sunlight.   

With fragile grace, it flutters by,   
A symbol of nature's tender art.   
From flower to flower, it alights,   
Spreading joy with every part.    

A metamorphosis, a wondrous sight,    
From a caterpillar, it did transform.   
Emerging with beauty and delight,   
A butterfly, both fragile and warm.   

Its journey, a reminder to us all,   
That change is a necessary part.   
Embrace the challenges that befall,   
And let your true colors impart.    

Oh, butterfly, enchanting and free,   
Teach us to embrace our own rebirth.   
To spread our wings and soar with glee,   
And find our place upon this Earth.    

For in your wings, we find a tale,    
Of resilience, beauty, and grace.   
Oh, butterfly, forever prevail,   
In the vastness of time and space.
