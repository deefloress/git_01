<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

"The sun was shining on the sea,   
      Shining with all his might:   
He did his very best to make.  
      The billows smooth and bright —   
And this was odd, because it was.  
      The middle of the night.   

The moon was shining sulkily,   
      Because she thought the sun.  
Had got no business to be there.  
      After the day was done —   
"It's very rude of him," she said,   
      "To come and spoil the fun."   

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

In meadows kissed by sunlit skies,  
Where gentle breezes softly sigh,  
A magical dance begins to rise,  
As butterflies take to the skies.  

Graceful wings of vibrant hue,   
Like pieces of the rainbow they strew,  
Fluttering through fields of morning dew,  
They enchant with colors anew.   

From cocoons of stillness, they emerge,   
Transformed, reborn, a sight to urge,   
Their delicate flight, a graceful surge,   
In harmony with nature's dirge.    

They dance on air, a whimsical show,   
A kaleidoscope of beauty they bestow,   
Their delicate wings, a vibrant glow,   
Like floating petals wherever they go.   

Butterflies, symbols of pure delight,    
In gardens, they bring dreams to light,    
With every flutter, a soul takes flight,    
Guided by nature's eternal insight.    

They remind us of life's transient art,     
A gentle reminder to follow our heart,       
To embrace change and play our part,     
In the symphony of creation, an exquisite chart.      

So let us cherish these creatures of grace,     
Their elegance and charm, a sacred space,     
In their delicate presence, we find solace,     
As butterflies continue their timeless chase.
